### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code

From the pivot table and the corresponding data chart, one can see that the majority of productions increase during April with a peak in May and a steady decrease throughout the  rest of the year. The April to May timeframe just so happens to be when most theatre productions are successful but also when many fail as well. October sees a shift in percentage failure with only 65 productions being successful and 50 failing, thus the fall time is the most likely time a production is to fail and the beginning of summer is when a production is most likely to succeed.

# Written Analysis of the Results
## Overview of Project
The VBA Challenge is ultimately about refactoring previously written code inside the Visual Basic application in Microsoft Excel. Refactoring runs through the data at one time without adding anything new but rather makes it more efficient by improving the logic within the code and using less memory. The code collected data from two datasets separated by year containing information of thousands of stocks and narrowed it down to twelve individual stocks with their total daily volume and returns.

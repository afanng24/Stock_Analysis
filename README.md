# Written Analysis of the Results
## Overview of Project
The VBA Challenge is ultimately about refactoring previously written code inside the Visual Basic application in Microsoft Excel. Refactoring runs through the data at one time without adding anything new but rather makes it more efficient by improving the logic within the code and using less memory. The code collected data from two datasets separated by year containing information of thousands of stocks and narrowed it down to twelve individual stocks with their total daily volume and returns. 

### Refactoring the Code
The refactoring of the code was accomplished a few different ways, first by using the ReDim function as opposed to Dim in order to resize the array. The tickerIndex was also resized in order to match each rowâ€™s ticker. The refactored code also looped through each row starting from zero in order to find the volume, starting prices, and ending prices of each year.
